<h3>Unit 3 Assignment</h3>
<h5>Objectives: The objective of this assignment is to create bigrams and trigrams which will calculate the probabilities of the next word by using the frequency of pairing with each word. By using laplace smoothing, we are able to handle the problems about words with 0 probabilities of appearing, and ______ perplexity value. Using classes, we are able to define objects, which we will use for code reusability.</h5>
